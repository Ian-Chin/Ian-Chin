  <summary>üé¨ Extra Skills: Video Editing</summary>
<br>
While playing at the highest competitive level in games like Valorant, I realized I was pulling off some insane plays that deserved to be remembered. Since I was already playing seriously, I figured why not clip my best moments and turn them into highlight reels? That‚Äôs how I got into **VIDEO EDITING**. I started compiling my gameplay into montages and edits for YouTube, experimenting with timing, effects, and sound sync. It began as a side skill but quickly became something I enjoyed and refined. Now, I use tools like **Davinci Resolve**, and sometimes **Hitfilm Express** to bring energy and style to my gaming content.
<br>
Feel free to check out my channel for some of the projects that I‚Äôve worked on!
